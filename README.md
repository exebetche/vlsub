Bug report: http://addons.videolan.org/content/show.php/?content=148752  

#### INSTALLATION:
Vlsub doesn't work on Vlc 2.1, use one of these instead:
* [vlc 2.0](http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/2.0.8/)
* [vlc 2.2](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/releases/2.2.0.html)

Create a directory "extensions" at this location if it doesn't exists, then extract the file "vlsub.lua" from the archive inside:
* Windows (all users): %ProgramFiles%\VideoLAN\VLC\lua\extensions\
* Windows (current user): %APPDATA%\vlc\lua\extensions\
* Linux (all users): /usr/lib/vlc/lua/extensions/
* Linux (current user): ~/.local/share/vlc/lua/extensions/
* Mac OS X (all users): /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/share/lua/extensions/
* Mac OS X (current user): /Users/%your_name%/Library/Application Support/org.videolan.vlc/lua/extensions/

To install the translations, copy the directory named "locale" into the VLSub working directory :
* To know this directory, once VLsub is installed as explained above, launCh VLC and open VLsub, and click "show config", and you will see it there.

#### USAGE:
* Start Vlc
* Start your video
* Click on the menu View > VLSub or VLC > Extension > VLSub on Mac OS X
* Click on "Search by hash" or "Search by name"
* Select a subtitles file on the list
* Click on "Download selection"
* That's it, the subtitles should appear on your video. 
* If you're not happy with your subtitles (wrong sync etc), you can select an other one and click "Download" again, that will erase the previous one and load it automatically.

#### Limitation:

Due to some bugs on Windows, if the path to your video contain non-english characters, the extension will not be able to save subtitles in this directory automatically (it will propose you to save it manually) and the "search by hash" method might be slower.

-> If possible, use a directory with english (ASCII) characters only to store your videos (on Windows only).
